## Game design

### Mechanics

- Text and dialogue-based. The story is narrated mostly via text (with auxiliary images and sounds, no animations), and you can progress the story by choosing how the character reacts to situations.
- RPG elements. Your character has abilities and stats points, and those influence what you can/cannot do. In-story choices have consequences for your character build.
- Inventory. The character has an inventory with the objects collected so far. Objects enable story choices. Inventory is kept simple, objects cannot be combined.
- Combat. The character faces hostile NPCs and can either fight or evade them (with multiple weapons/abilities).
- Map Navigation. The story takes place in multiple locations of the fictional city of Triste-le-Roy, and the player can navigate among them using a map.
- Save/restore. The player can save the game and resume from a previous point.
- PC-oriented. The game is meant to be played on a PC computer (desktop, laptop). If it can also run on a mobile device that's fine, but not a hard requirement.

### Theme and prose

- The game is inspired by hardboiled detective fiction, and follows the tropes of the genre.
- Sentences are short and direct, and use present tense.
- Slang is heavily used. See [reference1](https://www.miskatonic.org/slang.html) and [reference2](http://www.classiccrimefiction.com/hardboiled-slang.htm).
